    "This notebook illustrates how to use the TED_CartesianExplainer class.  The TED_CartesianExplainer is an implementation of the algorithm in the AIES'19 [paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3314273) by Hind et al.  It is most suited for use cases where matching explanations to the mental model of the explanation consumer is the highest priority; i.e., where the explanations are similar to what would be produced by a domain expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this goal, the TED (Teaching Explanations for Decisions) framework requires that the training data is augmented so that each instance contains an explanation (E).  The goal is to teach the framework what are appropriate explanations in the same manner the training dataset teaches what are appropriate labels (Y).  Thus, the training dataset contains the usual features (X) and labels (Y), augmented with an explanation (E) for each instance.  For example, consider a loan application use case, where the features are the loan application answers, and the label is the decision to approve or reject the loan.  The explanation would be the reason for the approve/reject decision.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The format of the explanation is flexible and determined by the use case.  It can be a number, text, an image, an audio, a video, etc.   The TED framework simply requires that it can be mapped to a unique integer [0, N] and that any two explanations that are semantically the same should be mapped to the same integer.  In many domains there are a list of reasons for making a decision, such as denying a loan, and these reasons would form the finite explanation space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this setup, the TED framework will train a classifier on this training set of instances of (X, Y, E); i.e, features, labels, and explanations.  When the classifier is given a new feature vector, it will produce a label (Y) and explanation (E).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many approaches to implementing this functionality.  In this notebook we illustrate the simplest implementation, TED_CartesianExplainer, which simply takes the Cartesian product of the label and explanation and creates a new label (YE) and uses this to train a (multiclass) classifier.   (See the TED_CartesianExplainer for more details.)   There are other possibilities, such as Codella et al.'s [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02299) at the HILL 2019 workshop.  However, we expect the interface to these implementations to be the same, and thus the user of the TED framework, illustrated by this notebook, would not have to change their code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple cartesian product approach is quite general in that it can use any classifier (passed as a parameter), as long as it complies with the fit/predict paradigm. \n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation assumes the initial problem is a binary classification problem with labels 0 and 1, and the explanations form a dense integer space from [0, NumExplanations -1].  The mapping of explanations to integers is performed by the user of the explanation as we will illustrate below.  This allows flexibility to the user if, for example, they want to change explanations from text to a video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we show how to use TED_Cartesian, we will describe our use case and associated dataset.  Then we will walk through the code, following these steps.\n",

    "# The dataset\n",
    "Given these features, we synthetically generate a dataset using the following distribution functions:\n",
    "- Position: 1 (45%), 2 (30%), 3 (20%), 4 (5%)\n",
    "- Organization: 1 (40%), 2 (30%), 3 (30%)\n",
    "- Potential: Yes (50%), No (50%)\n",
    "- Rating: High (15%), Med (80%), and Low (5%)\n",
    "- Rating slope: High (15%), Med (80%), and Low (5%)\n",
    "- Salary competitiveness: High (10%), Med (70%), and Low (20%)\n",
    "- Tenure: [0..24] (30%), [25..60] (30%), [61..360] (40%); values are evenly distributed within each range\n",
    "- Position tenure: [0..12] (70%), [13..24] (20%), [25..360] (10%); values are evenly distributed within each range\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the target distributions.  The actual distributions in the dataset vary slightly because they are selected randomly from these distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values for each feature are generated independently; i.e., it is equally likely that a person in position 1 and a person in position 4 will be in the same organization.  The only constraint among features is that the Position tenure cannot be greater than the Tenure (with the company); i.e., one cannot be in a position for longer than they have been with the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [dataset](https://github.com/IBM/AIX360/blob/master/aix360/data/ted_data/Retention.csv) and [code](https://github.com/IBM/AIX360/blob/master/aix360/data/ted_data/GenerateData.py) to generate is available as part of AI Explainability 360.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assigning labels\n",
    "To determine if a given employee, as represented by these features, should be target with a retention action, we would ideally ask a human resource specialist with deep knowledge of the circumstances for employee retention.  Under the TED framework, we would ask this expert for both a prediction of whether the employee was at risk to leave AND for a reason why the HR expert felt that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We simulate this process by creating 25 rules, based on the above features, for why a retention action is needed to reduce the chances of an employee choosing to leave our fictitious company.  These rules are motivated by common scenarios, such as not getting a promotion in a while, not being paid competitively, receiving a disappointing evaluation, being a new employee in certain organizations with inherently high attrition, not having a salary that is consistent with positive evaluations, mid-career crisis, etc.   We vary the application of these rules depending on various positions and organizations.  For example, in our fictitious company organization #1 has much higher attrition because their skills are more transferable outside the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these 25 rules would result in the label \"Yes\"; i.e., the employee is a risk to leave the company. Because the rules capture the reason for the \"Yes\", we use the rule number as the explanation (E), which is required by the TED framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "If none of the rules are satisfied, it means the employee is not a candidate for a retention action; i.e., a \"No\" label is assigned.  Although we could also construct explanations for these cases (see AIES'19 paper for such examples), we choose not to in this use case because there are many such cases where explanations for users will only be required in the \"Bad\" case.  For example, if a person is denied credit, rejected for a job, or is diagnosed with a disease, they will want to know why.  However, when they are approved for credit, get the job, or are told they do not have a disease, they are usually not interested in, or told, the reasons for the decision.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We make no claim that all predictions are in this category or that other personas (the data scientist, regulator, or loan agent) might want to know why for both kinds of decisions.   In fact, the TED framework can provide explanation for each decision outcome.  We are just not addressing these general situations in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset characteristics\n",
    "With the above distribution, we generate 10,000 fictious employees (X) and applied the 26 (25 Yes + 1 No) rules to produce Yes/No labels (Y), using these rules as explanations (E).  After applying these rules, the resulting dataset has the following characteristics:\n",
    "- Yes (33.8%)\n",
    "- No (66.2%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the 33.6% of \"Yes\" labels, each of 25 explanations (rules) were used with frequencies ranging from 20 (rule 16 & 18, counting from 0) to 410 (rule 13).  (When multiple rules applied to a feature vector (3.5% of the dataset, or 10.24% of Yes instances in the dataset), we chose the more specific rule, i.e., the one that only matched specified values for a feature, as opposed to matching all values for that feature.\n",

    "We now are ready to discuss the code that uses the TED_CartesianExplainer class to produce explanations."

    "The main advantage of this algorithm is that the quality of the explanations produced are exactly the same quality as those that the algorithm is trained on.  Thus, if you teach (train) the system well with good training data and good explanations, you will get good explanations out in a language you should understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this approach is that someone needs to create explanations.  This should be straightforward when a domain expert is creating the initial training data: if they decide a loan should be rejected, they should know why, and if they do not, it may not be a good decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this may be more of a challenge when a training dataset already exists without explanations and now someone needs to create the explanations.  The original person who did the labeling of decisions may no longer be available, so the explanations for the decisions may not be known.  In this case, we argue, the system is in a dangerous state.  Training data exists that no one understands why it is labeled in a certain way.   Asking the model to explain one of its predictions when no person can explain an instance in the training data does not seem consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with this situation is one of the open research problems that comes from the TED approach."
